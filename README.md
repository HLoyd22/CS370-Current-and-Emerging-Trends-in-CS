Treasure Hunt Game
--------------------------------------------------

Treasure Hunt Game is a type of pathfinding AI project. Using a deep Q-learning algorithm, the pirate learns the optimal way to find the
treasure from any position on the map. The agent that is used in this project went into the maze blind. It could not see the maze and 
would have to run through a random path to achieve the goal of the maze and find the possible outcome through an algorithm that has been 
set. This may not be achievable through the first run to have the pirate reach the treasure, so the agent may have to run multiple trials 
to achieve the goal. For this particular project, the agent went through 106 trials before the pirate reached the treasure within the 
rules that were set for the maze.

The Code
--------------------------------------------------

The code that was given was is the main setup for the game. This would include the GameExperience.py and the TreasureMaze.py. 
The code that I created myself includes a reinforcement learnign algorithm. This included the game loops that utilize the Keras and 
Tensorflow libraries. This helps to accomplish the pathfinding solution.

The Connection
--------------------------------------------------

A computer scientist helps identify and with the solution of complex problems within technology in innovative ways. I approached this 
problem with a techincal mindset. This wwas done through using the knowledge and resources that I have learned in order to help me solve
the problem more efficiently. 

One of the most important ethical concerns I learned about in this course regards hidden bias in AI. Any AI system can have biases 
injected into it and can harm our society without us aware being aware of it. As a developer of machine learning, I need to be aware of 
my own biases and attempt to design systems that are not inherently biased.
